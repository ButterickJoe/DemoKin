\arguments{
\item{ego_age}{integer. Age where ego is.}

\item{year}{integer. Year where ego is with \code{ego_age} age.}

\item{P}{numeric. A matrix of survival ratios with rows as ages and columns as years. The name of each col must be the year.}

\item{asfr}{numeric. A matrix of age-specific fertility rates with rows as ages and columns as years. The name of each col must be the year.}

\item{N}{numeric. A matrix of population with rows as ages and columns as years. The name of each col must be the year.}

\item{age}{integer. Ages, assuming last one as an open age group.}

\item{birth_female}{numeric. Female portion at birth.}

\item{Pb}{logic. Is given Pb as the first row in P?. Default \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with egoÂ´s age \code{x}, related ages \code{x_kin} and kind of kin
(for example \code{d} is daughter, \code{oa} is older aunts, etc.).
}
\description{
Implementation of Goodman-Keyfitz-Pullum equations but as a
weigthed average of possible ages at childbear of mothers and grandmothers of ego.
