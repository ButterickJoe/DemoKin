DemoKin is an R package for the demographic analysis of kinship networks using matrix-based models.  
It implements methods developed by Caswell and colleagues for estimating the number and age distribution of relatives under various demographic assumptions.

## Features

- Estimate kin counts and age distributions for various types of relatives
- Support for one-sex and two-sex models
- Time-invariant and time-varying approaches
- Multi-state models incorporating additional variables like parity or education
- Visualization tools for kinship networks

## Installation

You can install the development version of DemoKin from GitHub:

```{r, eval = F}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("IvanWilli/DemoKin")
library(DemoKin)
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use DemoKin:

```{r, eval = T}

# Run a one-sex time-invariant kinship model using Swedish data from 2015
kin_results <- kin(
  p = swe_px[,"2015"],        # Survival probabilities
  f = swe_asfr[,"2015"],      # Fertility rates
  time_invariant = TRUE       # Use time-invariant model
)

# Visualize the expected number of living relatives by age
kin_results$kin_summary %>%
  rename_kin() %>%
  ggplot2::ggplot(ggplot2::aes(age_focal, count_living)) +
  ggplot2::geom_line() +
  ggplot2::facet_wrap(~kin_label, scales = "free_y") +
  ggplot2::labs(
    title = "Expected number of living relatives by age",
    x = "Age of focal individual",
    y = "Number of relatives"
  )
```
