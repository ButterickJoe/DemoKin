# DemoKin: Implementing matrix kinship models in R
`r format(Sys.time(), "%b %d %Y")`

`DemoKin` uses matrix demographic methods to compute expected (average) kin counts from demographic rates under a range of scenarios and assumptions. The package is an R-language implementation of Caswell (2019), Caswell (2020), and Caswell and Song (2021). It draws on previous theoretical development by Goodman, Keyfitz and Pullum (1974).

## Installation

You can install the development version from GitHub with:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("IvanWilli/DemoKin")
```

## Time-invariant example

Consider an average Swedish woman called 'Focal'. For this exercise, we assume a female closed population in which everyone experiences the Swedish 2015 mortality and fertility rates at each age throughout their life (the 'time-invariant' assumption in Caswell [2019]). 

We then ask:

<!-- > How can we characterize Focal's kinship network? -->
> How many living relatives does Focal have at each age?

Let's explore this Using the Swedish data included with `DemoKin`.

```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=8}
library(DemoKin)
swe_surv_2015 <- DemoKin::swe_px[,"2015"]
swe_asfr_2015 <- DemoKin::swe_asfr[,"2015"]
swe_2015 <- kin(U = swe_surv_2015, f = swe_asfr_2015, time_invariant = TRUE)
```

*px* is the survival probability by age from a life table and *f* are the age specific fertility ratios by age (see `?kin` for details). 

Now, we can visualize the implied kin counts (i.e., the average number of living kin) of Focal at age 35 using a network or 'Keyfitz' kinship diagram with the function `plot_diagram`:

```{r, fig.height=6, dpi=900,fig.width=8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# We need to reformat the data a little bit
kin_total <- swe_2015[["kin_summary"]]
# Keep only data for Focal's age 35
kin_total <- kin_total[kin_total$age_focal == 35 , c("kin", "count_living")]
names(kin_total) <- c("kin", "count")
plot_diagram(kin_total, rounding = 2)
```

Relatives are identified by a unique code:

```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=8, echo=FALSE}

relatives <- c(
  "coa" = "Cousins (through aunt older than mother)"
  , "cya" = "Cousins (through aunt younger than mother)"
  , "d" = "Daughter"
  , "gd" = "Grand-daughter"
  , "ggm" = "Great-grandmother"
  , "gm" = "Grandmother"
  , "m" = "Mother"
  , "nos" = "Nieces through mother's older sister"
  , "nys" = "Nieces through mother's younger sister"
  , "oa" = "Aunt older than mother"
  , "ya" = "Aunt younger than mother"
  , "os" = "Older sister"
  , "ys" = "Younger sister"
  )

kable(data.frame(Code = names(relatives), Relative = relatives, row.names = NULL) )
```

## Vignette

For more details, including an extension to time varying-populations rates, deceased kin, and multi-state models, see `vignette("Reference", package = "DemoKin")`.
If the vignette does not load, you may need to install the package as `devtools::install_github("IvanWilli/DemoKin", build_vignettes = T)`.
