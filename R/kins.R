#' Estimate kin counts

#' @description Implementation of Goodman-Keyfitz-Pullum equations in an stable or not framework.
#' @details See Caswell (2019) for details on stable option.
#' @param ego_age integer. Age where ego is.
#' @param year integer. Year where ego is with `ego_age` age.
#' @param P numeric. A matrix of survival ratios with rows as ages and columns as years.
#' The name of each col must be the year.
#' @param asfr numeric. A matrix of age-specific fertility rates with rows as ages and
#' columns as years. The name of each col must be the year.
#' @param N numeric. A matrix of population with rows as ages and columns as years.
#' The name of each col must be the year.
#' @param age integer. Ages, assuming last one as an open age group.
#' @param birth_female numeric. Female portion at birth.
#' @param stable logical. Stable assumption given `year` rates.
#'
#' @return A list with:
#'  *
#'  * A data frame with egoÂ´s age `x`, related ages `x_kin` and kind of kin (for example `d` is daughter, `oa` is older aunts, etc.).
#'  * A data frame with available kins at each age of ego.
#'  * A data frame with available kins at actual age of ego.
#'  * Mean age of each type of kin at actual age of ego.
#'  * Total of each type of kin at actual age of ego.
